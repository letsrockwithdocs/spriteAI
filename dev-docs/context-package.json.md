In JSON's embrace, a project takes flight,
SpriteAI, version one, ready to ignite.
No description yet, but potential untold,
A module type, with index.js to behold.

Scripts await, tests not yet defined,
An author unnamed, license ISC assigned.
Dependencies listed, tools of the trade,
Axios, Jimp, OpenAI, and Sharp arrayed.

A canvas of code, a digital art,
Where sprites may dance, and AI impart.
This package file, a blueprint so neat,
For a project that's poised, to make pixels fleet.

Oh, SpriteAI, what wonders you'll bring,
When your code comes alive, and algorithms sing.
From this humble JSON, great things may grow,
A testament to creation, line by line, row by row.
