In the realm of pixels, a test doth reside,
Where backgrounds fade and colors subside.
A file named "removeBackground.test.js" stands tall,
Its purpose to ensure no errors befall.

With Jimp and fs, it starts its tale,
Importing tools to help it prevail.
The function "removeBackgroundColor" it seeks to test,
Ensuring its performance is nothing but the best.

Input and output paths, it doth declare,
And expected results, with utmost care.
Before each test, it cleans the slate,
After all tests, it seals its fate.

The white background, it aims to erase,
Comparing results with expected grace.
Non-existent files, it handles with might,
Throwing errors when things aren't right.

Oh, test file, guardian of code so true,
Your vigilance ensures our function's debut.
In the world of sprites, you play your part,
Keeping our background removal smart.
