# Coding Standards and Best Practices

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices for contributing to the SpriteAI project. Following these guidelines will help maintain consistency and readability across the codebase.

## Code Structure

- Use ES6 module syntax (`import`/`export`) for organizing code.
- Group related functions and constants together.
- Place utility functions at the top of the file, followed by main exported functions.
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations.

## Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., `removeBackgroundColor`, `generateCharacterSpritesheet`).
- Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., `OpenAI`, `Jimp`).
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the purpose or content.

## Function Structure

- Use arrow functions for short, single-purpose functions.
- For longer functions, use the `function` keyword.
- Use destructuring for function parameters with default values.

Example:
```javascript
export const generateCharacterSpritesheet = async function(description, options = {}) {
  const {
    states = ['idle', 'walk', 'run', 'attack'],
    framesPerState = 6,
    size = '1024x1024',
    // ... other options
  } = options;
  
  // Function body
};
```

## Comments and Documentation

- Use JSDoc-style comments for functions, especially those exported as part of the API.
- Include brief inline comments for complex logic or non-obvious code.
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes.

## Error Handling

- Use try-catch blocks for error-prone operations, especially in async functions.
- Provide meaningful error messages.

## Code Formatting

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces recommended).
- Place opening braces on the same line as the statement.
- Use semicolons at the end of statements.

## Specific Patterns

### Options Object Pattern

For functions with multiple optional parameters, use an options object:

```javascript
function someFunction(requiredParam, options = {}) {
  const {
    optionA = defaultValueA,
    optionB = defaultValueB
  } = options;
  
  // Function logic
}
```

### Async/Await with External APIs

When interacting with external APIs (like OpenAI or file systems), use async/await:

```javascript
async function exampleApiCall() {
  try {
    const response = await someApiFunction();
    // Process response
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('API call failed:', error);
    // Handle error
  }
}
```

### Image Processing Chain

For image processing operations, chain methods when possible:

```javascript
await sharp(inputBuffer)
  .resize(width, height)
  .toFormat('png')
  .toFile(outputPath);
```

## Version Control

- Write clear, concise commit messages.
- Use feature branches for new features or significant changes.
- Keep pull requests focused on a single feature or fix.

By adhering to these standards and practices, we can maintain a clean, efficient, and collaborative codebase. Remember that code readability and maintainability are as important as functionality.
