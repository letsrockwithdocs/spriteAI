# Setting Up SpriteAI Locally

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the SpriteAI project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the SpriteAI repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spriteAI.git
   cd spriteAI
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the project dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will install the following dependencies as specified in the `package.json` file:
   - axios (^1.6.1)
   - jimp (^0.22.10)
   - openai (^4.17.4)
   - sharp (^0.32.6)

3. **Configuration**

   If the project requires any configuration files (e.g., API keys, environment variables), create them now. Look for any `.env.example` files in the project and create corresponding `.env` files with your own values.

## Project Information

- **Name**: spriteai
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Type**: module
- **Main file**: index.js
- **License**: ISC

## Running the Project

As of now, there are no specific run scripts defined in the `package.json`. To run the project, you may need to execute the main file directly:

```bash
node index.js
```

## Development

To start developing, you can edit the `index.js` file or create new JavaScript files as needed. Remember that this project is set up as an ES module, so you can use `import` statements for importing dependencies.

## Testing

Currently, there are no test scripts specified in the `package.json`. If you need to add tests, you can modify the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file to include appropriate test commands.

## Contributing

If you're contributing to this project, make sure to follow any coding standards and git workflows established by the project maintainers.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup or runtime:

1. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed
2. Check that you're using a compatible Node.js version
3. Verify any required configuration files or environment variables are set up correctly
