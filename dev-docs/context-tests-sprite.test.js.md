In lines of code, a test unfolds,
A sprite's creation, story told.
Of knights and houses, pixels dance,
As Jest commands each function's stance.

Describe and it, the rhythm flows,
Expectations high, as knowledge grows.
Sharp images, dimensions true,
A thousand pixels, square and new.

Async functions, promises kept,
Through buffers and frames, secrets leapt.
Base64 whispers, data streams,
In this test file, sprites live their dreams.

Generate and verify, the cycle spins,
Each assertion, a battle it wins.
In workspaces where sprites come alive,
This humble test helps code to thrive.
